# HybVIO

**A visual-inertial odometry system with an optional SLAM module**.

This is a research-oriented codebase, which has been published for the purposes of verifiability and reproducibility of the results in the paper:

* Otto Seiskari, Pekka Rantalankila, Juho Kannala, Jerry Ylilammi, Esa Rahtu, and Arno Solin (2022). **HybVIO: Pushing the limits of real-time visual-inertial odometry**. In *IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)*.

It can also serve as a baseline in VIO and VISLAM benchmarks. The code is not intended for production use and does not represent a particularly clean or simple way of implementing the methods described in the above paper. The code contains numerous feature flags and parameters (see `codegen/parameter_definitions.c`) that are not used in the HybVIO but may (or may not) be relevant in other scenarios and use cases.

## Setup

Here are basic instructions for setting up the project, there is some more detailed help included in the later sections (e.g., for Linux).

* Install CMake, glfw and ffmpeg, e.g., by `brew install cmake glfw ffmpeg`.
* Clone this repository with the `--recursive` option (this will take a while)
* Build dependencies by running `cd 3rdparty/mobile-cv-suite; ./scripts/build.sh`
* Make sure you are using `clang` to compile the C++ sources (it's the default on Macs).
  If not default, like on many Linux Distros, you can control this with environment variables,
  e.g., `CC=clang CXX=clang++ ./scripts/build.sh`
* (optional) In order to be able to use the SLAM module, run `./src/slam/download_orb_vocab.sh`

Then, to build the main and test binaries, perform the standard CMake routine:

``` bash
mkdir target
cd target
cmake -DBUILD_VISUALIZATIONS=ON -DUSE_SLAM=ON ..
# or if not using clang by default:
# CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake ..
make -j6
```

Now the `target` folder should contain the binaries `main` and `run-tests`. After making changes to code, only run `make`. Tests can be run with the binary `run-tests`.

To compile faster, pass `-j` argument to `make`, or use a program like `ccache`. To run faster, check `CMakeLists.txt` for some options.

### Arch Linux

List of packages needed: clang, cmake, ffmpeg, glfw, gtk3

### Debian

On Debian Stretch, had to install (some might be optional): clang, libc++-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libgstreamer1.0-dev, libvtk6-dev, libavresample-dev.

### Raspberry Pi/Raspbian

On Raspbian (Pi 4, 8 GiB), had to install at least: libglfw3-dev and libglfw3 (for accelerated arrays) and libglew-dev and libxkbcommon-dev (for Pangolin, still had problems). Also started off with the Debian setup above.

## Benchmarking and the `main` binary

To run benchmarks on EuRoC, TUM and SenseTime datasets and reproduce numbers published in https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11857, please follow the instructions in https://github.com/AaltoML/vio_benchmark/tree/main/hybvio_runner.

If you want to test the software on individual datasets, e.g. to see various real-time visualizations, you can use the `main` binary. For example to run an EuRoC dataset, you can do the following:

 1. In [`vio_benchmark`](https://github.com/AaltoML/vio_benchmark) root folder, run `python convert/euroc_to_benchmark.py` to download and convert the EuRoC data
 2. Symlink that data here: `mkdir -p data && cd data && ln -s /path/to/vio_benchmark/data/benchmark .`

Then inside the `target/` folder use, e.g.:

    ./main -i=../data/benchmark/euroc-v1-02-medium -p -useStereo

In general, to run the algorithm on recorded data, use `./main -i=path/to/datafolder`, where `datafolder/` must at the very least contain a `data.{jsonl|csv}` and `data.{mp4|mov|avi}`. Such recordings can be created with

 * [Android VIO tester](https://github.com/AaltoML/android-viotester)
 * [realsense-capture](https://github.com/AaltoVision/realsense-capture)
 * [mynt-capture](https://github.com/AaltoVision/mynt-capture)
 * [zed-capture](https://github.com/AaltoML/zed-capture)
 * [oak-d-capture](https://github.com/SpectacularAI/oak-d-capture)

Some common arguments to `main` are:

* `-p`: show pose visualization.
* `-c`: show video output.
* `-useSlam`: Enable SLAM module.
* `-useStereo`: Enable stereo.
* `-s`: show 3d visualization. Requires `-useSlam`.
* `-gpu`: Enable GPU acceleration

You can get full list of command line options with `./main -help`.

### Key controls for `main`

These keys can be used when any of the graphical windows are focused (see `commandline/command_queue.cpp` for full list).

* `A` to pause and toggle _step mode_, where a key press (e.g., SPACE) processes the next frame.
* `Q` or Escape to quit
* `R` to rotate camera window
* The horizontal number keys 1,2,â€¦ toggle methods drawn in the pose visualization.

When the command line is focused, Ctrl-C aborts the program.
